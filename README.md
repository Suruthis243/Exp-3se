# EXP 03- RAILWAY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
## AIM:
To develop the Online Ticket Reservation System using Star UML tool.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
### Step 1: Problem Identification
Manual railway operations such as ticket booking, train scheduling, and passenger management are slow and error-prone. The system aims to automate these processes for efficiency and accuracy.

### Step 2: Requirement Analysis
Users: Passenger, Admin, and Booking Clerk.
Main Functions: Train schedule management, ticket booking/cancellation, seat availability check, fare calculation, and report generation.
Non-Functional Needs: High reliability, data security, and user-friendly interface.

### Step 3: System Design
Draw UML diagrams: Use Case, Class, Activity, Sequence, Communication, and Package diagrams.
Create database tables for Trains, Passengers, Tickets, and Schedules.
